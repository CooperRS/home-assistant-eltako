# Changes and Feature List

## Version 1.2.0 Support for Multiple Gateways
* Full support for gateway [Eltako FAM-USB](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-standard-en/three-phase-energy-meters-and-one-phase-energy-meters/fam-usb/)
* Target temperature synchronization between climate panel in Home Assistant and thermostat implemented.
* BaseId validation for gateways introduced. It will show warnings as output logs.
* Device ids can be displayed in device name optionally.
* Home Assistant eventing prepared to support more than one gateway
* Manual installation of multiple gateways/hubs implemented. 

* **&#x26A0; Breaking Changes &#x26A0;**
* Configuration: 'base_id' in 'gateway' in mandatory. See [docs](./docs/update_home_assistant_configuration.md)
* Events in Home Assistant for switch telegrams have got different event_ids. This affects automations reacting on old event ids. See [docs](./docs/rocker_switch/readme.md)

## Version 1.1.3
* Added read-only support for gateway [Eltako FAM-USB](https://www.eltako.com/en/product/professional-standard-en/three-phase-energy-meters-and-one-phase-energy-meters/fam-usb/)

## Version 1.1.2
* Docs for configuration added
* USB port for serial communication can be configured in gateway section.
* Configuration keys were made consistent. Replaced '-' through '_'. This change may require adaptation to existing configurations.

## version 1.1.1 - BugFix
* Problems with general-settings in configuration file.

## version 1.1.0 - Heating and Cooling
* Change file introduced
* **Climate Panel introduced** incl. support for actors like FAE14, FHK14, F4HK14, F2L14, FHK61, FME14 and EEP A5-10-06 as well as control panels like FTAF55ED.
* Docs for Climate Panel/Heating and Cooling
* Refactoring
  * Introduced many explicit types.
  * Logging improved
* Prepared config for other gateway types. (Currently supported Eltako fam14 and fgw14-usb)
* Support of different gateways e.g. enOcean USB300 with different protocol version (ESP3)
* Added teach-in buttons for climate and temperature controller
* Added Air Quality Sensor with EEP A5-09-0C for e.g. FLGTF
* Integrate Eltako FUTH ([Wireless thermo clock/hygrostat](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/_bedienung/FUTH65D_12-24VUC_30065741-1_gb.pdf))
  * Temperature synchronization with FUTH and Home Assistant Climate (temperature controller) not yet properly working.
* Fast status change added. You can set per configuration is you want to wait for actuator response or if you directly want to see the status change in HA.

## Version 1.0.0 Baseline

## Backlog
* Config generation shall be come more easy.
* Docs for Configuration Schema
* Extend device discovery for heating and cooling actuators
* Integrate Eltako FMZ14 ([Multifunction Time Relay](https://www.eltako.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/_bedienung/FMZ14_30014009-2_gb.pdf))
* Gateway availability checks for send commands.
* Reconnect for serial interface.
